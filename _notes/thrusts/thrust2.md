title: "Thrust 2: Develop binary analysis tools to determine package integration"
---

> Develop binary analysis tools to determine which packages can be integrated together, even when built through different means (e.g., manually or with a package manager). This requires reverse engineering stripped binaries with no debug information to find entry/exit points, exported data types/structures, other ABI relevant semantics and metadata, and validating equivalence or near equivalence in function behavior.
